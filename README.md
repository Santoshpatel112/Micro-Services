</p>

> **Each service (User, Captain, Ride, Gateway) is a standalone Node.js app, communicating via REST APIs and managed by a central Gateway.**

---

## ✨ Features

- Modular, scalable microservices for ride-hailing platforms
- Centralized API Gateway for routing, security, and service discovery
- JWT authentication and secure cookie management
- MongoDB for persistent, scalable data storage
- Easy to extend: add payments, notifications, analytics, etc.
- Docker-ready for containerized deployment

## 🚙 Animated Service Routing

<pre>
Client  ===>  Gateway  ===>  🚗 User Service
                      ===>  🚕 Captain Service
                      ===>  🚙 Ride Service
         <===  (Status/Updates from Ride Service, Captain, User)
</pre>

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

- **Microservices Structure:** Each domain (User, Captain, Ride) is a separate Node.js service.
- **Gateway:** Single entry point, handles authentication, routing, and load balancing.
- **Port Sharing:** All services connect to the Gateway, which manages communication.
- **Ride Service:** Orchestrates ride creation, assignment, and status updates between User and Captain.
- **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently.
- **Security:** JWT-based authentication, secure cookies, and centralized validation.

## 📖 API Overview

| Service   | Endpoint Example           | Description                       |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| User      | `/users/register`         | Register a new user               |
| User      | `/users/login`            | User login                        |
| Captain   | `/captains/register`      | Register a new captain            |
| Captain   | `/captains/login`         | Captain login                     |
| Ride      | `/rides/create`           | Create a new ride                 |
| Ride      | `/rides/status`           | Get ride status                   |
| Ride      | `/rides/assign`           | Assign captain to ride            |
| Gateway   | `/api/*`                  | All requests routed via gateway   |

---

## 🎬 Example Request Flow

1. User requests a ride via the client app.
2. Request goes to the **Gateway**.
3. Gateway authenticates and forwards to **Ride Service**.
4. Ride Service interacts with **User** and **Captain** services as needed (assigns captain, notifies user, updates status).
5. All responses are routed back through the Gateway to the client.
